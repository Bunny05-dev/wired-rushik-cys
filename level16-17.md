# level16-17

→ Firstly, I used  ‘nmap’ command to find ports which were accessible, and then found that total of 5 ports were active, out of which only one contained a private ssh key
→ I tried to establish connection using ‘openssl’ and other commands to see whether the ports contained such key.
→ I found out that port 31790 contained the ssh key which I then copied to a file and named it as sshkey.
→ I used the ssh key in the initial login itself to access level 17
